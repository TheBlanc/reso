# Reso

A simple and light-weight reservation app. Reso is designed with small restaurants in mind, to be used by restaurant staff in order to keep their reservations neat and organized.
[See Reso Live](https://resorestaurantapp.herokuapp.com/)

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo and run the bundler and db migrations
